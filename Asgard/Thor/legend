Thor - Norse God of Thunder, the son of Odin and Jord, the earth goddess. Thor was the strongest of the Aesir, the collective name for the the principal race of Norse gods who lived in Asgard, and with the All-Father Odin, ruled the lives of mortal men. Thor married the golden-haired Sif, a Goddess of fertility. He kept a mistress named Jarnsaxa (the iron "cutlass"), with whom he had two sons, Magni and Modi and his daughter is Thrud.
Thor was usually portrayed as a large, powerful man with a red beard, flowing hair, hearty enjoyment of food and drink and eyes of lighting. Despite his ferocious appearance, he was very popular as the protector of both gods and humans against the forces of evil.
