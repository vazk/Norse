In Norse mythology, Hreidmar is the avaricious king of the Dwarves who captured three gods with his unbreakable chains. He was father of Fafnir, Ã“tr and Regin. He owned a house of glittering gold and flashing gems built by Regin and guarded by Fafnir. After Otr was accidentally killed by Loki, the Aesir gods repaid Hreidmar with Andvari's gold and the cursed ring Andvarinaut. Fafnir and Regin killed Hreidmar for the ring. Fafnir decided he wanted Andvarinaut for himself, so he turned into a dragon and drove Regin away.
